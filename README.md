# Predict Pokemon stats with the help of the TensorFlow library

The dataset we'll be using is the compilation of stats and traits for the Pokémon video games. Pokémon is a popular game for generations of Nintendo handheld video game consoles where players collect and train animal-like creatures called Pokémon. We'll be creating a model to try to predict whether a Pokémon is a legendary Pokémon, a rare type of Pokémon who's the only one of its species.

There are a lot of existing compilations of Pokémon stats, but we'll be using a .CSV version found on Kaggle. There's a download button on the website, so save the file to your computer and we can begin.
